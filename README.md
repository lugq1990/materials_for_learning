Materials summary during daily learning

This repo is a daily learning path to enhance the ability of software engineering, including basic computer info, distributed, AI, cloud, python etcs.

For each folder is a sub-materials, will try to add a functionality that will match each of the folder of the content here, so that for later will get be easier to read. Some of them are based on LLM models output like ChatGPT.

## TODO: add index for each of them.
